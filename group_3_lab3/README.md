David wrote the CSV to CSV and JSON to CSV extractors. McKinley found the datasets, wrote the XML to CSV extractors, wrote the merged CSV, and wrote part of the report.

At one point in her life, my mother taught English to students in Hawaii, and I have a couple friends who have English as a second language, so I was curious what it was like on the administrative side of teaching English to children. 
I liked that the datasets were not terribly big, and had very similar columns, but still had different values from each other.

The columns I decided to keep were the (_id, _uuid, _position, and _address columns) OR (the organizationid, gradelevel, test, orglevel, organizationname, schoolyear, metstandarddatnotes, metstandarddenominatordat, metstandarddat, metstandardlabel, and dataasof columns.)  I did this because of the ease of only keeping these columns from the XML file.
